# react-native-audio-player

This is the repository for our React Native bridge that allows
a React Native app to control our native audio players via
Javascript.

This repo contains our bridge plus an example app that we use
for development. The bridge code exists [in a subdirectory in the
example code](https://github.com/feedfm/react-native-feed-media-audio-player/tree/master/example/node_modules/react-native-feed-media-audio-player)
so we can test things while editing the code (see [SETUP](https://github.com/feedfm/react-native-feed-media-audio-player/blob/master/SETUP.md) for
the reasoning behind the layout).
